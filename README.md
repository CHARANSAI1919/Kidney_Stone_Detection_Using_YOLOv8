# Kidney_Stone_Detection_Using_YOLOv8
This project focuses on detecting kidney stones in ultrasound images using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The goal is to provide a fast and accurate deep learning solution to assist in the early diagnosis of kidney stones, which are often difficult to detect due to low contrast and noise in ultrasound scans.

The model was trained on a custom-annotated dataset of kidney ultrasound images with bounding boxes around stone regions. YOLOv8â€™s streamlined architecture offers improved performance, faster inference, and better generalization compared to previous versions, making it well-suited for medical image analysis.

ðŸ“„ This project is part of a research study comparing object detection models for clinical applications in kidney stone identification.
